summary: "This project uses ArcGIS API for JavaScript and KRPano panoramic viewer to create a DIY 360 panoramic tour a-la Google Streetview of the College Court Apartments in State College, PA."
---

<p>I developed a web application using ArcGIS API for JavaScript and KRPano panoramic viewer that provides access to a DIY 360 panoramic tour of the College Court Apartments in State College, PA. My motivation for this project was to refresh my skills in creating virtual tours and to review how to integrate KRPano with ArcGIS web maps. I collected images of the College Court complex on 10/22/2022 using an inexpensive consumer-grade Ricoh Theta S panoramic camera. The camera was triggered by GPS coordinates using a simple Python script that I ran on an Android smartphone in a QPython environment. I used KRPano, a widely used and lightweight HTML5  panoramic viewer. I also hosted the GIS such as building footprints, panoramic tour coverage, and individual picture locations in ArcGIS Online, and implemented a tiny web-map application so the users could easily view the panoramic images by clicking on the map.</p>
